def lexico_permute_string(s):
    ''' Generate all permutations in lexicographic order of string `s`

        This algorithm, due to Narayana Pandita, is from
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Generation_in_lexicographic_order

        To produce the next permutation in lexicographic order of sequence `a`

        1. Find the largest index j such that a[j] < a[j + 1]. If no such index exists, 
        the permutation is the last permutation.
        2. Find the largest index k greater than j such that a[j] < a[k].
        3. Swap the value of a[j] with that of a[k].
        4. Reverse the sequence from a[j + 1] up to and including the final element a[n].
